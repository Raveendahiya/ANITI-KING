# ANITI-KING
Overview

This project aims to detect SQL injection attacks using machine learning techniques. It provides a scalable and efficient solution for identifying potential SQL injection attempts in web applications.

Features

Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a trained machine learning model to identify patterns associated with SQL injection attacks.
Web Application Integration: Easily integrates with web applications to provide real-time detection.
Scalable: Designed to scale with the size and complexity of web applications.

Dataset:- 

The first part of the project was applying ML algorithms like Logistic Regression, Support vector machines, Decision Trees and Random forests on the a dataset token from kaggle.
